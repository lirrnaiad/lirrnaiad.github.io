# A webpage about me, my favorite anime, and video games.
### **Made as a project for Empowerment Technology in Grade 11** <br>

**"Create a portfolio using html tags"** <br>
Since the important part is applying what we've learned in our class (HTML only, barely any CSS). This project makes heavy use of CSS templates created by other people. <br>
<br>
Written and edited using Sublime Text 3

## About Me
![about-me](https://github.com/lirrnaiad/weebpage/assets/99702949/41fc1b22-fc08-40b5-80c7-e2c713c50625)
This project contains a short "about me" section that introduces the "different parts" of me.
At the time of writing this documentation (2 years later), I find it a bit cringe now but for the sake of preservation I'll keep it as is.


## Carousels
### This project contains two interactible carousels which can be interacted using the arrow icons (<) and (>).
![carousel1](https://github.com/lirrnaiad/weebpage/assets/99702949/32da6891-0d6d-460f-b001-4c7ec6a0a4f6)
The first carousel at the top is a slideshow of my top 5 anime (at the time). <br>
This carousel will auto-move after 5 seconds and move to the next image. <br>
<br>

![carousel2](https://github.com/lirrnaiad/weebpage/assets/99702949/78ae8537-4d23-49ae-a5f2-238ad2905a7b)
The second carousel at the bottom is a slide of the seasonal anime that were airing at the time of creating this project. <br>
<b>You can click on the images on both carousels and it will redirect to their respective MyAnimeList pages.</b>

This project contains two news articles I considered at the time of making this project very exciting. <br>
2 years later, they're unfortunately still not finished yet. <br>
I look forward to them up to this day, though!
